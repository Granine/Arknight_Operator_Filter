# Arknight Operator Filter
A operator filtering tool based on operator ability/stats/tags for the mobile game Arknights
---
## Before evyerthing
- This is a practice project for learning C so it included a wide range different algorism/methods to accomplish the same things (eg. parallel approach for file read write while in reality there are only ~250 items to store parallization is completly unnessasory)
- I decided to make this tool becasue I cannot find a great operator filter tool unline that supports filter by stats or operator ability such as RES debuff or ATK buff etc
- The project is unfinished at the moment with only storing feature and no lookup, I will keep working on it when I have the time
## How to use
Any java compiler with java version 12 or up, interated through terminal

## Planned function
1) Operator look up
2) Adding new operator and save the new operator
3) Filter operator by name/ID/stats/Recurit Tag/Ability (Freeze, Silence, Damage buff, etc) etc

## Planned feature
1) Complete object oriented design based on Abstract data type "Operator" and "FilterTags"
2) Save action hitory to file as well as any mods to operator information
3) Thread and exposure safe
